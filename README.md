# nlparse
The purpose of this collection of code is to parse sentences.

Warning: You are very likely to discover slightly non-standard Linguistics in this repo.
(e.g. English preposition "to" is parsed as an auxilary verb when forming the infinitive)
If this bothers you, feel free to fix it (via pull request) or open an issue telling me where I messed up.
