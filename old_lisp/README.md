#nlparse/old_lisp

This is where I have put all the code from when this project was written in Lisp.

It will probably be removed when I have finished converting it.

Feel free to mess around with it though.

Note, ```nlparse/old_lisp/morphology-utils.lisp``` depends on cl-ppcre, which it loads using quicklisp, which it assumes is in the default directory. If you are trying to use this yourself, you may need to change the first few lines of that file.
